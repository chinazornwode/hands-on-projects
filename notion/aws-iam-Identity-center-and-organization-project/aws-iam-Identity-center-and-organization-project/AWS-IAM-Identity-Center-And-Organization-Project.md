- Checked our Account Policies

![image.png](image%2069.png)

- Checked our Account Role

![image.png](image%2070.png)

## Question: why is there this permissions in the admin account?

`ANSWER: We made a mistake in permission set earlier by assigning permission that was not meant for the admin which  is unnecessary needed in this context so removed it but was still showing due AWS is kind of keeping the logs or history of whatsoever happed so that when there is an Audit. They can know what happened and when it happend`

## üéì Lessons Learned

- **Strategic Value of Multi-Account Architecture**: The team discovered that a well-structured multi-account strategy doesn't just improve security, but also creates clearer ownership boundaries and simplifies cost allocation across development, staging, and production environments.
- **Proactive Security Through Identity Federation**: Beyond simply implementing MFA, the team learned that AWS Identity Center creates a centralized authentication point that significantly reduces credential management overhead and security risks compared to managing multiple IAM users across accounts.
- **Permission Templating for Scalability**: The creation of standardized permission sets revealed that defining access patterns once and deploying them consistently across accounts dramatically improves governance and reduces the risk of permission drift over time.
- **Cross-Account Access Workflow Optimization**: The team gained practical experience in balancing security with usability by establishing seamless role-switching capabilities that maintain strict security boundaries while providing a friction-free user experience.
- **Documentation as Risk Mitigation**: The detailed documentation process wasn't just for knowledge transfer - it created an auditable trail that reduces organizational risk by ensuring configurations can be replicated, troubleshot, or validated against compliance requirements.
- **Naming Convention Discipline**: The team discovered that consistent naming conventions across accounts, groups, and permission sets significantly reduced operational complexity and created a more intuitive user experience for both administrators and end users.
- **IAM Trust Relationship Criticality**: The team gained deeper appreciation for how IAM trust relationships form the foundation of cross-account access, and how small misconfiguration details can completely break otherwise well-designed security architectures.
